title: Hiking Adventure – Cape Split, Nova Scotia
---

One of my favorite outdoor experiences was hiking Cape Split, a breathtaking headland on the Bay of Fundy. 
- It is a 16 km round trip that took me through lush coastal forests, opening up to dramatic cliffside views where the tides meet in powerful currents. 
- The fresh ocean air, the sound of waves crashing far below, and the panoramic view from the tip made the long trek completely worth it. 
- It was a perfect mix of challenge, serenity, and connection with nature — and a reminder that persistence always leads to rewarding views.
