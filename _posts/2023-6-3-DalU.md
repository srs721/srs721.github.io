title: Wrapping up Masters at Dalhousie!
---

The courses I took
- Serverless Computing
- Cloud Architecture
- Advanced Design of Algorithms
- Advanced Database Systems

Some of the projects I worked on:

- Trivia Titans

    - Developed a multi cloud ( AWS and GCP ) serverless architecture gaming platform hosted on Google Cloud Run.
    - Trivia Titans is a highly interactive, multi-cloud trivia gaming platform designed to support real-time multiplayer gameplay with global scalability and robust security. Built using AWS and GCP, it blends cloud-native services to deliver a seamless user experience across authentication, game sessions, team management, and analytics.
    
    - Key Features:
        - Secure authentication: Firebase Authentication for first-factor (social/email login) and AWS Lambda + DynamoDB for second-factor (Q&A-based) verification.
        - Real-time gameplay: Trivia matches with timed questions, live scores, chat, and hint-sharing built using Firestore and Pub/Sub.
        - Dynamic leaderboards: Looker Studio dashboards visualize performance by player, team, category, and time range.
    


- Tax Calculation System
    - AWS Services used - Cloudformation, S3, Lambda, ElasticBeanstalk, API Gateway, EventBridge and SNS
    - The system is designed to handle user uploads of CSV files, verify file formats, calculate tax region specific, and send notifcations via SNS. Additionally EventBridge to schedule file deletes from S3.

    - Analysis of project security: Securing data during transit and at Rest: ElasticBeanstalk is secured using https over http. Least Privilege Principle in AWS using IAM policies to ensure permissions are granted specifically.
