title: From Python and Node.js to Go!

Very recently on a 1:1 meeting with my manager he told me about an upcoming project in the geospactial domain at Bayer Pharma. I was quite amused and asked the details, he said they are looking for someone with Golang experience!

I am learning Go and developing small projects for hands on experience. The reason for me to learn go was not just because of the new project but also I like learning new things. I have come across many other developers using go these days as it combines features of both node.js - event loops, async patterns and python - concurrency.

I worked on a small project(postgres API) -

Setting up Go
- Installing go, understood about go.mod and package management

Building REST API
- Used Gin, setted up routes (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), retuning objects using gin.H

Database Integration
- Using postgres via sqlx

Lessons I learned:
- Go syntax surprise! - It is C derivative
- Use of interfaces
- Go routines and channels for concurrency

Here is a link to the project that I created -
