I recently attended an insightful tech talk by Andrew Burke (Co-Founder & Developer at BeanCounter Technologies) that explored the evolving role of programmers amidst decades of technological change, automation, and AI advancements.

Starting with the history of programming languages like COBOL, which has been around for over 70 years, Andrew illustrated how similar claims of “programmer replacement” have echoed through time. He explained how hype cycles around new technologies often lead to inflated expectations, only to be followed by reality checks revealing the continued need for human creativity, problem-solving, and adaptation.

The talk also focused on the current AI revolution, highlighting tools such as GitHub Copilot. Andrew discussed their capabilities, limitations, and why these AI-powered coding assistants serve to augment developer productivity rather than replace software engineers.

Key Takeaways for Developers:

- Embrace new tools and adapt quickly to evolving technology landscapes.
- Use automation and AI to offload repetitive tasks and focus on complex problem-solving.
- Continuous learning is essential as developer roles and workflows continue to evolve.
- This event was a compelling reminder that while automation and AI are transforming software development, skilled programmers remain vital to creating innovative solutions and driving the tech industry forward.
