title: Canoeing and Star Gazing - Kejimkujik National Park
---

Paddling across the calm waters of Kejimkujik National Park was pure tranquility!
- Surrounded by wilderness, with loons calling in the distance. 
- On the same day, as night fell, the park revealed its other magic: an unspoiled night sky filled with countless stars, planets, and the shimmering Milky Way. 
- Canoeing by day and stargazing by night made it a truly unforgettable experience of Nova Scotiaâ€™s natural beauty.
